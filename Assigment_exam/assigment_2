1)

input: distance, fuel efficiency, train ticket

calculate the gass used by: fuel efficiency * 4$
calculate the cost of maintance: distance * 0.05
sum the cost together
if the cost of using car is higher than the tran ticket
    then report that it is cheaper to buy train ticket
else
 report that it is cheaper to drive


 2)

 input: distance work,  work days, distance personal use, free time usage

 calculate the total distance of using the car for work: distance work * working days
 calculate the total distance og using the car during free time: distance personal use * fre time usage
 sum total distance for both usage
 calculate the fraction of work by dividing the distance by total distance
 calculate the fraction of free time by dividing by total distance
 report the fraction of the car usage for work and the fraction for free time


3)

while the length of the digit is less than six:
    number <- 1 - 1/(3 + i) +1/(5 + i)

list: prime
number: pi_div_4
create a table with all the prime numbers
for i in range 100000
    if i%= 0 then
        append i in prime

while the length of the digit is less than six:
    pi_div_4 = 1 - 1/prime[i] + 1/prime[i+1]
    i += 1
    convert pi_div_4 to a string and check the length
